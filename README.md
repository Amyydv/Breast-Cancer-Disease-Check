# Breast-Cancer-Disease-Check
The Breast-Cancer-Disease decision tree dataset is a collection of data points that can be used to train a decision tree model for the early detection of breast cancer. The dataset contains 569 data points, each of which is a description of a breast cancer tumor. The data points include features such as the tumor's radius, texture, perimeter, and other characteristics. The target variable is the tumor's diagnosis, which can be either malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous).

The Breast-Cancer-Disease decision tree dataset was created by the University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics. The dataset is publicly available and can be downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The Breast-Cancer-Disease decision tree dataset can be used to train a decision tree model for the early detection of breast cancer. The model can be used to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign. The model can be used to help doctors make decisions about the treatment of breast cancer patients.
